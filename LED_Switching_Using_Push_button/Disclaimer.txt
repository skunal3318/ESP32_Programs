# The code in the folder is for the nodemcu 1.0 , but tested and working on both microcontrollers.
Wokwi Circuit --> ESP32
Physical Circuit --> NodeMCU 1.0
Sketch.ino --> NodeMCU 1.0

--> If you want to use the ESP32 Board then change the pins to :
int led1_pin = 0;
int led2_pin = 2;
int button_pin = 4;
And then it will work perfectly on that too.


Thanks...
